### MATH 230:Calculus and Vector Analysis

MATH 230: Calculus and Vector Analysis (3 credits) is the third in a sequence of calculus courses for engineering, science, and related fields. It covers vectors in space, vector-valued functions, functions of several variables, and various integrals and theorems. This version is more theoretical, with sophisticated problems and in-depth discussions. The course includes four 50-minute lectures per week, assessed through exams, quizzes, homework, and writing assignments. Classes are held Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday at 8:00 AM. You can learn more about the topics and the decription of this course through this website (https://sites.psu.edu/altoonamath/mathematics-courses-offered-at-penn-state-altoona/math-230-calculus-and-vector-analysis/#:~:text=Blue%20Book%20Description%3A%20Three%2Ddimensional,schedule%20MATH%20230%20for%20credit.).

### Professional Development: Financial API Research

I am working on a **API Financial Integration** with **Professor Kaamran Raahemifar**, where we are developing financial APIs. An API (application programming interface) is a tool used to share content and data between software applications. APIs are used in a variety of contexts, such as embedding content from one website into another, dynamically posting content from one application to display in another, or extracting data from a database in a more programmatic way than a regular user interface might allow.

In our project, we aim to design a secure, scalable API that will allow businesses to interact with financial systems. This research involves creating programmatic searches of financial databases, extracting statistical data, and dynamically querying financial information. I work on this project for around **10 hours a week**, contributing by writing code and developing features. This experience is helping me improve my skills in **software engineering and financial technology**. To learn more about financial APIs, visit this page (https://www.bill.com/blog/financial-apis).
